# Exploring Country-Level CO2 Emissions Accountability Within the Context of International Trade Relationships

## Project Description

As the final project for the course Data Visualization within the University of Virginia's School of Architecture and part of the curriculum for the Master's of Science in Data Science program, students were tasked with conceptualizing, designing, and creating both a web-enabled, data-driven, dynamic visualization and a static visualization unified by the broad, overarching theme of trust. 

## Data

Data for this project was collected from the [World Bank's DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home) and was compiled and wrangled in JupyterLab using Python. All relevant data for this project can be found as CSV files in the Data folder of this repository, and the cleaning.ipynb file within the same folder contains the necessary code to produce the data.csv and trade_matrix.csv files supporting the visualizations associated with this project.
